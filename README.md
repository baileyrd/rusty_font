# rusty_font

A `#![no_std]` + `alloc` sovereign TrueType/OpenType font table parser and
glyph rasterizer for the **Rusty Mill** ecosystem.

## What's real

Previously a total stub: `Font::parse` never read the file (hardcoded
`units_per_em: 2048, num_glyphs: 256`), `glyph_index`/`glyph_outline`
returned a fixed placeholder box, and the rasterizer filled a hardcoded
rectangle regardless of input. All of that is now real:

- **`ttf.rs`** — a real `sfnt` table directory parser: `head`/`maxp`
  metadata, `cmap` format-4 (the segment-based Unicode BMP mapping every
  Latin-script TrueType font ships) with the spec's exact pointer
  arithmetic, `cmap` format-12 (segmented coverage over the full 21-bit
  Unicode range, used by fonts with supplementary-plane glyphs — verified
  against a real Nerd Fonts icon set), `loca`/`glyf` simple-glyph outline
  extraction (contours, on/off-curve quadratic points, run-length-encoded
  flags and coordinate deltas), and composite-glyph assembly (component
  records resolved recursively and transformed — scale, x/y scale, or a
  full 2x2 matrix, plus an offset — into the composite's coordinate
  space).
- **`cff.rs`** — a real CFF table parser (INDEX/DICT structures, Top DICT
  and Private DICT, global and local Subrs) and Type 2 charstring
  interpreter for `OTTO`-tagged (CFF-flavor) OpenType fonts: all the
  path-drawing operators (moveto/lineto/curveto variants including the
  `flex` family), hint operators (stem/hint-mask byte-length accounting,
  so parsing doesn't desync on real fonts' hint data), and subroutine
  calls (`callsubr`/`callgsubr` with the spec's index bias). CFF's cubic
  Bézier curves are flattened to on-curve line segments at parse time
  rather than represented exactly, since the rest of the crate's outline
  model (and the rasterizer) is shaped around TrueType's on/off-curve
  quadratic points.
- **`rasterizer.rs`** — a real scanline rasterizer: flattens TrueType's
  on/off-curve quadratic Bézier contours into line segments, then fills
  with the **non-zero winding rule** (the rule TrueType itself specifies —
  required for a glyph like `O` to render with its counter/hole actually
  unfilled, not solid).

**Verified against real system fonts** where the machine running the tests
has them: `cargo test` parses `arial.ttf`/`cour.ttf` from
`C:\Windows\Fonts`, resolves real character-to-glyph mappings, extracts
real outlines (checking e.g. that `A` has ≥2 contours — the outer shape
plus its triangular counter), and rasterizes them — including a direct
test that `O`'s rendered center pixel is unfilled (the hole) while its
ring is filled, proving the winding rule is genuinely correct, not just
"produces some pixels." Behavior that a real system font can't exercise
on demand (a font shipping a `cmap` format-12 subtable, a specific
composite-glyph transform) is instead tested against a minimal
synthetic `sfnt` built directly in the test, byte for byte, rather than
skipped. `examples/ascii_render.rs` dumps real rasterized letters as
ASCII art for a visual sanity check:

```
cargo run --example ascii_render
```

## Known, deliberate gaps

- **Composite-glyph point matching** (`ARGS_ARE_XY_VALUES` unset — a
  component positioned by matching a point on it to a point on a
  previously-placed component, rather than by an explicit x/y offset) is
  rare in real-world fonts and isn't implemented; that one component is
  skipped rather than fabricating a position for it, while the rest of
  the composite still assembles.
- **CID-keyed CFF** (per-glyph `FDArray`/`FDSelect` private dicts — used
  mainly for CJK fonts) isn't supported; standard (non-CID) CFF, the
  common case for a professional OpenType text font, is.
- **The deprecated `seac`-style accent composition** via CFF's 4/5-arg
  `endchar` isn't implemented — a documented gap in the same spirit as
  the TrueType composite point-matching one above.
- **CFF outlines are flattened, not exact** — Type 2 charstrings' cubic
  Bézier curves are approximated as line segments at parse time (fixed
  8-segment subdivision per curve) rather than represented as exact
  curves, since this crate's outline model is TrueType's on/off-curve
  quadratic points.
- **No hinting** — outlines rasterize at their natural shape; no
  instruction execution or grid-fitting.
